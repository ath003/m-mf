# m&mf
m&mf is an AI system for Lusternia, an online MUD. It has advanced and adaptable curing capabilities, defence raising, name highlighting, influencing, and other features. It is the free and open-source version of what used to be m&m.

# Downloading
To download the system for use, [see here](https://github.com/m-mf/m-mf/releases). Please consult the documentation for installation instructions.

# Documentation
Documentation for m&mf can be found [here](http://m-mf.github.io/m-mf/)

m&mf now also has a discord channel to ask questions about the server which can be found [here](https://discord.gg/KGWjGSU)

# Contributing
To code in the system itself, follow instructions below on how to set it up. See also the [developer readme](Developer readme.md) for more useful information.

## License
m&mf is licensed under [Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/). You must read the license before using m&mf source code.

## Setup

1. Obtain m&mf source code. Either clone using Git (which will allow you to easily update the m&mf code and contribute back) or a [zip snapshot](https://github.com/m-mf/m-mf/archive/master.zip) (which doesn't require knowledge of Git).
1. Uninstall m&mf/m&m you currently have installed. This is necessary to run the developer version of the system.
Note: Uninstall maynot be necessary if you are using a separate new profile for development
1. Install Lua, LuaFileSystem, LuaRocks, Penlight, and 7zip.
    1. Windows: download and install latest [LuaForWindows](https://github.com/rjpcomputing/luaforwindows/releases), which all the Lua components indluded. Install 7zip [from here](http://www.7-zip.org/download.html).
    1. Ubuntu: install [Lua](https://apps.ubuntu.com/cat/applications/lua5.1/), [LuaFileSystem](https://apps.ubuntu.com/cat/applications/lua-filesystem/), [LuaRocks](https://apps.ubuntu.com/cat/applications/luarocks/), [Penlight](https://apps.ubuntu.com/cat/applications/lua-penlight/), and [7zip](https://apps.ubuntu.com/cat/applications/p7zip-full/).
    1. OSX: install [Homebrew](http://brew.sh).
        1. Using Brew from your Terminal: `brew install lua` and `brew install p7zip`.
            1. Afterwards, make sure to `brew install lua5.1`.
        1. Using LuaRocks from your Terminal: `luarocks install luafilesystem` and `luarocks install penlight`
1. Open the command-line and navigate to the m&mf folder, and run:

       On Ubuntu:
       ./generate.lua -o &lt;your class&gt;

       In Windows:
       generate.lua -o &lt;your class&gt;
       
       On OSX:
       lua5.1 generate.lua -o &lt;your class&gt;


1. Replace &lt;m&mf Git location&gt; with the path to the XML files, and then run this command in Mudlet.

        lua installModule([[<m&mf Git location>/m&m (carriontracker).xml]]) installModule([[<m&mf Git location>/m&m (demesne).xml]]) installModule([[<m&mf Git location>/m&m (harvester).xml]]) installModule([[<m&mf Git location>/m&m (healing).xml]]) installModule([[<m&mf Git location>/m&m (import me).xml]]) installModule([[<m&mf Git location>/m&m (influencer).xml]]) installModule([[<m&mf Git location>/m&m (meldtracker).xml]]) installModule([[<m&mf Git location>/m&m (namedb).xml]]) installModule([[<m&mf Git location>/m&m (obey).xml]]) installModule([[<m&mf Git location>/m&m (peopletracker).xml]]) installModule([[<m&mf Git location>/m&m (plsorter).xml]])
1. When prompted to find the m&mf folder location, select the &lt;m&mf Git location&gt;/own m&mf folder
1. Go to Toolbox > Module Manager and tick all 'don't sync' boxes, so they become 'sync', for all m&mf XML files.

All set!

## Editing

Code in m&mf comes from two places - Mudlet and the Lua files. In order to make a change in Mudlet (alias/trigger/script), edit in Mudlet directly, then hit Save Profile. Since you've installed the xml files as modules with the sync option, changes will be written back to the XML file automatically, and you'll see your Git client instantly show what you've changed. In order to make a change in the Lua files, edit the raw-* files directly (not the ones in the bin/ folder), save, rebuild m&mf (using *generate.lua -o \<your class>* above) and reload it (by restarting your profile or Mudlet).
